## Teach Something You Know

<img class="img-right" src="{filename}/images/Teach_tn.jpg" alt="Shawn Porter speaking to a class at TheLab.ms" />

TheLab.ms is made up of volunteers and people who are willing to share knowledge on any topic they are passionate about.

You do not have to be an expert in a topic to share what you know about that topic with others.

We invite anyone who is willing to share their knowledge and/or information on any topic of their liking to contact our [Education Coordinator](mailto:teach@thelab.ms) to set up a time and announcement of the class or presentation.
