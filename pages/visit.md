We hold an open house at our Education Center every second Saturday of the Month.

Come and see our space and get an in person introduction into what we do!

We usually have soldering stations available.  So, if you have a small project to work on bring it with you.

We also have the 3D printers fired up and ready to print and maybe even some board games.

Join in on the fun and make yourself at home.

If you are having trouble finding us:  We share the same parking lot with Fishmongers and Marinara Pizza and are located next door to Coffee Del Rey.

If you cannot make it to an open house feel free to join us at any other event we have announced on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/TheLab-ms/).  You are guaranteed that at least one person will be there that can show you around.
